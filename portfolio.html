            <h2>Project 1: Dark Mode & Light Mode Toggle</h2>
            <p>
                I developed a website with a user-friendly <a href="https://darkmodeappassignment.netlify.app/" target="_blank">dark mode</a> and <a href="https://darkmodeappassignment.netlify.app/" target="_blank">light mode</a> toggle feature. Users can switch between these two modes to enhance their browsing experience. It's a simple yet effective way to make a website more accessible and visually appealing.

            <h2>Project 2: Item Search & Purchase</h2>
            <p>
                I have built an <a href="https://filter-emerging.netlify.app/">item search</a> website. Another project I worked on is an e-commerce website that allows users to search for items and make purchases. I implemented a search bar that enables users to find products easily. Additionally, I integrated a secure payment system for smooth transactions, making it a convenient platform for online shopping.

            <h2>Project 3: Responsive Navigation Bar</h2>
            <p>
                For smaller screens, I created a responsive navigation bar that allows users to easily navigate the website. This navigation bar ensures a smooth user experience on mobile devices.
